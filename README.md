This repository provides resources for molecular dynamics simulations and executing long-running tasks on SaladCloud. It includes blogs, reference designs, benchmarking code, demonstration applications, and test reports.

If you are new to SaladCloud, we recommend starting with [the SCE Architectural Overview](https://docs.salad.com/products/sce/getting-started/architectual-overview) and [the Docker Run on SaladCloud][https://docs.salad.com/tutorials/docker-run]. [The Build High-Performance Applications](https://docs.salad.com/tutorials/high-performance-apps) shares best practices along with proven insights from customers who have successfully built large-scale AI inference applications and run molecular dynamics simulations, using tens to thousands of Salad GPU nodes.
